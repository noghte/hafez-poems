Displaying a random poem from Hafez's Divan, written in Svelte as a serverless app.

## Running the app

- After cloning the repo, run `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`) to install dependencies.
- Run `npm run dev` to start the development server. 
    - It will run on port `3034` by default.
    - You can run the app on a different port by modifying `"dev": "vite dev --port 3034"` in the `package.json` file.
